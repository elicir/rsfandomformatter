{{Quote|16th Head of the Uesugi clan. One of the best warriors in the Sengoku period, his strength led others to call him "God of War" after his death. He lived honorably, and never fought for his own desire. From "Sengoku Legend."}}

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;" >Kenshin and Shingen</span>
{{CharTalk|Maya|Phew... I think that's about it.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|That was pretty good.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Yes. After multiple read throughs, the scene from the battles of Kawanakajima is finally coming to life.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Going to the actual location was a big help.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Ideally, it'd be nice if we could make the combat scene even more heated...}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|But we can't change the lines, so we can only delve deeper into the character's feelings.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|You're right...}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|If only we could find something in the relationship between Kenshin and Shingen that livens up the roles...}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Relationship... Huh.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Do you have an idea?}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Saijo-san. How would you describe Shingen and Kenshin's relationship in one word?}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Rivals?}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Right. The two are often depicted as lifelong rivals, but do you know about the few encounters they've had where they weren't fighting?}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Bien sur. Of course I do. You're talking about Kenshin sending Shingen salt, right?}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Yes. That famous anecdote is the origin of the proverb, "show humanity even to one's enemy".}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|It's also said that during Shingen's last moments, he told his sons to rely on Kenshin should the Takeda clan fall into a predicament.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|He said that even though Kenshin is the enemy, he is a reliable man.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|It's said when Shingen died, Kenshin shed tears of sadness in front of his vassals.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|It's hard to believe when they've fought for twelve years.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Their relationship can't be summed up as simple rivals.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|It could be because Kenshin and Shingen acknowledged each other as worthy rivals that they carved their names in history.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|I agree. They only shone because they fought. If Kenshin didn't have Shingen, he might have just ended as an ordinary warlord.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Kenshin in my mind is one who shines on the battlefield.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|There's also the belief that if the battles of Kawanakajima didn't happen, Shingen would have conquered the nation.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|You could say the same for Kenshin. At the battle of Tedorigawa, he was able to take down Oda's army in an instant.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|In the battle of Mikatagahara, Shingen wiped out the Oda and Tokugawa allied forces.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|I'm sure Shingen being the one to aim for the capital first would've been the one to conquer the nation.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Non! It would've been Kenshin.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|On what grounds?}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Grounds? Well, that's...}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Kenshin went to the capital to restore the Ashikaga shogunate. It's hard to believe that the honorable Shingen would be aiming to conquer the nation.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Ngh... Okay, for argument's sake we'll say Shingen would be the one to conquer the nation. BUT! Kenshin is the one who won the battles of Kawanakajima!}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|You're mistaken. The Takeda army were the last ones remaining on the battlefield, hence the victors.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Kenshin outwitted Shingen and defeated the Takeda army!}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|The Uesugi army was winning in the first half, but the Takeda army won the second half.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Takeda army had more casualties!}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|The number of casualties don't matter. The one who remains on the battlefield is the victor.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Kenshin won!}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|No. It was Shingen's victory.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine & Maya|...!}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|...Saijo-san, let's calm down.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|...Right. Our feelings right now...}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Yes, let's continue with the read through like this.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|I'll take these emotions out on you, Maya Tendo.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Bring it on, Claudine Saijo.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Ready? Let's begin.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Heh heh, this is going to be good.}}

Chapter 2=
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;" >Sengoku Simulation Game</span>
{{CharTalk|Futaba|I've got double the military strength and my skill and morale are at the highest level... All right, let's attack.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|To war!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Come on, go! Onward!}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|What are you doing, Futaba?}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Oh, sorry. Was I too noisy? I got too into my game.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Game?}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Yeah, I'm trying out this history simulation game. I thought it might be useful for "Sengoku Legend".}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|What kind of game is it?}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|You choose a force from the Sengoku daimyos and unify Japan by taking down all the castles across the nation...}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|It helps you remember the names of the shoguns and what actually happened in history appear as events in the games, so you can learn a lot.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|That sounds fun! Can you unify Japan with any daimyo?}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Yeah, that's what's interesting about this game. Depending on how the game plays out, you can even see Nobunaga unify Japan without dying at Honnoji.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|So it's like what if scenarios. Which daimyo family are you using?}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Of course the Tokugawa family.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Oh? There's a battle scene on the screen. Are you the one that's attacking?}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Yeah. The opponent is quite a handful... Oh.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|This castle... Is this Kasugayama Castle? Hey! That's the Uesugi family's castle!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Sorry. I'm in the middle of fighting Uesugi Kenshin.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Arrete! Don't fight him! The Uesugi family will go down!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Even if you say that... The point of this game is to unify the nation, so...}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Oh. You're losing, though.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Huh? What?! I attacked with double the forces and still got beat up!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Aw, my Tokugawa army...}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Just as you'd expect of Kenshin. He's not called the "God of War" for nothing.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Kenshin is too strong...}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Heh heh. I want to play too.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|It's a single player game. But if you're interested, I could teach you.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Yes, please.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|If you invest and develop commerce in the castle town, you'll earn war funds. You can also increase yield by cultivating land.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|I see. So you can build a town too. It's fun.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|And you can't forget about public order. If you only focus on fighting and neglect the people, riots will happen.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Huh, this game is deep.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|There are other things too, but you can learn them as you play.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Thanks, Futaba. I'll do my best to aim for unification of the nation with the Uesugi family.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Don't get sucked into it, otherwise you'll end up neglecting rehearsals.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Bien sur. Of course. I'm just playing it to help prepare for my role.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Yay! I did it, Futaba!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|...? What is it?}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Look! I finally beat the Takeda army!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Oh, you did. The Takeda territory now has the Uesugi army's flags on them.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Heh heh. All that's left is Shingen's stronghold, Kai Province.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Next I'll mobilize all troops and take down Takeda...}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Heh heh, I knew it.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Oh, Tendo. We're just playing a simulation game.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|And you are playing the Uesugi family. The Uesugi family is easy to play with Kenshin as the head and numerous strong warlords under him.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|...Which means, you're playing too?}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Yes. I've already cleared it, though.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Wait! You cleared it? You mean you've unified Japan?!}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Yes.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Impressive. I only taught you the other day and you've already unified the nation?}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|W-Wait a minute! Show me your game data!}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Sure, here you go.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|...!}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|...!!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Let's have a look. Oh! Wow! Nobunaga, Ieyasu, Kenshin, and Tadakatsu too! Everyone's getting along.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Yes. I made all the shoguns who appear in "Sengoku Legend" friends.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Ngh... I... I'm also going to make Shingen my friend and unify Japan!}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|By all means.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|......}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|I think it'll be beneficial to have Shingen as your ally.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|...Games are fun, but how about we do a read through?}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Playing the game has given me ideas of various types of acting I'd like to try with you.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Which means the game was useful, yeah?}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Yes. It's a very fun game that's historically accurate and gives you a sense of what the Sengoku period must've been like.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|It's been great reference material. Thanks for telling me about it, Futaba.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Let's go to the rehearsal room.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Hey, Tendo. Do you get anything after clearing the game? Like a bonus footage or something.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Yes. Once you unify Japan...}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Stop! I haven't finished it yet!!}}

{{CharTalk|Claudine|"Sengoku Legend" is a story where all the shoguns in it are leads. Every shogun gets their own spotlight. Don't miss it.}}

Bond Level 30 Talk=
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Did you know there's a theory that Kenshin was female? It came from him never having had a wife.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Kenshin's favorite book was "The Tale of Genji" that talks about Hikaru Genji's romance. He has a surprisingly feminine side to him.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|I don't know what the truth is, but he might've been a Sengoku period shogun who was feminine and sensitive.}}
