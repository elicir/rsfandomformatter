>Act 3 "Where Are the Stars"
Nana\"You've finally arrived... 'Fool'."
Nana\"This is the end of your journey."
Mahiru\"This is the end you've been searching for... The Garden of Truth."
Yachiyo\"Truth... you say?"
Yachiyo\"You're saying that this desolate desert... This garden, where anything and everything is dead, is the truth I've been searching for?"
Nana\"Even if you continue to walk in search of your truth. Continue to fight for your justice—"
Nana\"There's no guarantee you will find something at the end of it all."
Mahiru\"That is also another truth."
Yachiyo\"That is also another..."
Yachiyo\"This... is my..."
Yachiyo\"..."
Yachiyo\"Pfft... Hahaha!"
Mahiru & Nana\"...!?"
Yachiyo\"In which case... This isn't my final destination."
Yachiyo\"Because you see... I have yet to seize anything with these hands of mine!"
Yachiyo\"Justice, you say? That's got nothing to do with me. Truth, you say? That's not something that can be seen nor touched!"
Yachiyo\"I'm still in the middle of my journey. And my journey shall not end until I have something solid in these hands!"
Yachiyo\"O 'Sun'! Light up the path that I must go down!"
Ichie\......
Ichie\......
Yachiyo\...?
Yachiyo\"Excuse me... 'Sun'?"
Ichie\"Roger that!"
Yachiyo\Whoa?!
Ichie\"'Fool's' next destination – a bright future!"
Ichie\"As the idol of the skies, the one who shines in the sky, I will light it up for you!"
Mahiru & Nana\...?
Claudine & Tamao\...?!
Junna\Wait a minute...!
Hikari\Yep, ad-lib.
Karen\I knew it! Ichie-chan's... line as the "Sun" is—
Junna\It should have been, "Very well. As the 'Sun', I shall light your path until the end of the horizon!"
Karen\Right? That surprised me!
Junna\I mean, Tamao-san has put in ad-libs before in past script readings, but...
Hikari\This is the first time... a line has changed so much.
Hikari\But...
Hikari\But that "Sun" is...
Yachiyo\Heh heh...
Yachiyo\"I expected nothing less from you, 'Sun'!"
Yachiyo\"Now dispel the darkness of twilight and end the evening! Direct me down my new path with that smile of yours!"
Ichie\"Consider it done! All right, 'Fool', where to?"
Ichie\"North, east, west, south! Past and future! A traveler can go wherever they please!"
Yachiyo\"Yes, I can go anywhere!"
Junna\Whoa... Tsuruhime-san ad-libbed too...!
Hikari\It's an ad-lib exchange, but... But...
Fumi\......!
Fumi\Ugh...!
Junna\Wait, huh? Yumeoji-san?!
Karen\Why are you standing up all of a sudden?
Fumi\I can't stand to watch this any longer... I'm going to stop them.
Karen & Junna\What?
Fumi\We've finally gotten to this point after numerous script readings... Thanks to Ichie's ad-lib, it's all messed up.
Fumi\I have to stop them now—!
Shiori\—N-no, you can't!
Fumi\What... Sh-Shiori?!
Shiori\...Fumi, you can't.
Fumi\Shiori. Step aside.
Shiori\...No.
Shiori\Because... Yachiyo-senpai and Otonashi-san's improv— their stage isn't over yet.
Shiori\I won't allow you, as an outsider who's not standing on that stage, to cut the performance short.
Fumi\Shiori...
Shiori\Let's continue watching until the performance ends.
Fumi\But this kind of performance...!
Maya\It is an ad-lib exchange, but starting with the "Sun", all these characters have never existed...
Hikari\—They're alive.
Maya\Exactly.
Fumi\Huh...?
Maya\They've read and analyzed the flow of the script and having understood their lines, they're now exploring the boundaries of their own characters and playing around with it.
Maya\Which means...
Akira\Yes... They've broken down and digested the personalities of the characters written in the script...
Akira\And made the characters into their own.
Fumi\......!
Mahiru\Um, that's...
Mahiru\"Ahem. Then allow me to give you a piece of advice."
Yachiyo\"Oh? The great 'Hermit' has advice for me?"
Mahiru\"Head for the west, young one."
Mahiru\"At the end of the mainland is a small village. Once a year, they hold a 'Star Festival' to give praise to the stars in the night sky."
Mahiru\"They say the one who can catch the two stars that shine beautifully in the sky will have eternal hope in their hands."
Yachiyo\"Catch a star... That might be the real light I should be aiming for..."
Yachiyo\"Okay, I've decided. It's the start of a new journey!"
Yachiyo\"Haha... Once again, I decide by myself to go on a reckless and outrageous journey."
Yachiyo\"Nevertheless... Will you still come along, my dear?"
Claudine\"Heh heh... Of course."
Claudine\"Without me, you won't be able to wash that shirt of yours or even boil water!"
Claudine\"I'll come too."
Claudine\"Because I want to be there with you... to share the joy of the moment you've grasped something solid with your hands."
Claudine\"Also... your contract with her will not end until your journey is finished."
Claudine\"Am I right, 'Death'?"
Tamao\...Heh heh.
Tamao\"If the journey ends, the soul of the 'Fool' will be sacrificed. However... if the journey doesn't end, neither will the contract."
Tamao\"It's a bit of a bother, but... well, I suppose that's just the way it has to be."
Tamao\"Because without your soul, I can't return to Yomi."
Tamao\"I shall accompany you on your journey for now."
Yachiyo\"Please do, 'Death'. If you were to go, I would feel lonely."
Nana\"But... is this okay?"
Yachiyo\"Hm?"
Nana\"Things like changing the path and the destination... Is that really something we're allowed to do?"
Yachiyo\"...Obviously."
Yachiyo\"We're humans. Humans continue to change."
Yachiyo\"Which means, so will our destinations as well as our paths."
Yachiyo\"It's fine to change. Nothing in this world can remain the same."
Ichie\"Even for I, who shine in the sky – a day will come when I will burn out."
Nana\"..."
Yachiyo\"Go down the path illuminated by the 'Sun' and attend the Star Festival. This is the start of my magnificent journey. How fitting."
Ichie\"Is everybody ready?"
Ichie\"Let's head off on our brand new journey!"
Ichie\"'Sun'! What are we to do if you're leading?!"
Ichie\"Right, I'm supposed to be lighting the path! Sorry!"
Yachiyo\Pfft...!
Ichie\Heh heh...
Ichie & Yachiyo\Hahahaha!
Claudine & Ichie & Yachiyo\Hahahaha!
Masai\All right, all right! Let's stop there!
|2 Where Are The Stars
>|Part 2
Masai\Great work, everyone!
Ichie\*huff*... *huff*...
Ichie\I'm so sorry, everyone!
Ichie\I couldn't stop ad-libbing!
Masai\No, no, no. That was wonderful!
Ichie\But the lines changed so much...
Masai\Hmm. What do you think, Shion-chan?
Amemiya\Good.
Amemiya\It was really good...!
Amemiya\I would never have come up with such lines for the "Sun"...
Ichie\Well, you know how you and the script team had come up with that kind of character for Shiori-chan's "Chariot" in the last draft?
Shiori\Th-That kind of...! I think the "Chariot" is very cute!
Ichie\Yeah, I think so too!
Ichie\That's why, instead of having the "Sun" acting all important up in the sky...
Ichie\I thought we could make it a bright and sunny character who's close to the "Fool".
Amemiya\Yes... Yeah! Good, it was great!
Amemiya\It really stood out... Something the stage has never seen before!
Masai\Yes, I agree!
Ichie\I'm so glad!
Masai\Thank you, everyone! Let's take a break!
Ichie\Whew...!
Ichie\You're amazing, Yachiyo-chan.
Yachiyo\Huh?
Ichie\You returned all of my ad-libs!
Yachiyo\Not at all. It's thanks to how carefully you set up your ad-libs.
Yachiyo\It may appear to be a mess, but the nuance is actually the same as the original lines...
Yachiyo\You even made sure that it would connect well to my next lines, didn't you?
Ichie\I didn't think that far!
Mahiru\Really? In which case... that's amazing. That means your "Sun" moved on its own accord.
Claudine\It definitely turned into a "Sun" that only Ichie could pull off.
Ichie\Aw, it really wasn't that big a deal!
Shiori\......
Shiori\Wow...
Shiori\The exchange between Otonashi-san's "Sun" and Yachiyo-senpai's "Fool" has heated up the play so much...
Shiori\My heart is racing just from watching it...
Shiori\...I'm glad it wasn't stopped.
Fumi\......!
Shiori\...I also...
Shiori\I also... want to put on such a lively performance.
Shiori\I want to stand on that stage soon.
Shiori\Fumi... What do you think?
Fumi\......
Fumi\The ad-libs just happened to go down well, that's all.
Fumi\This doesn't mean things will go down the same way on the day of the "Performance Festival".
Shiori\Fumi...
Masai\Great work, everyone!
Masai\This marks the end of the script readings for creating the characters!
Amemiya & Masai\Thank you very much for all of your time!
All\Thank you!
Masai\We'll be polishing the script and finishing up the final draft based on all the script readings we've had so far.
Amemiya\Um... Look forward to it!
All\Okay!
Yachiyo\Oh, um!
Masai\Yes, Tsuruhime-san!
Yachiyo\Can I ask a question?
Masai\Sure, go ahead!
Yachiyo\About this play...
Yachiyo\The characters are the twenty-two Arcana from the Marseille and Waite versions of tarot cards...
Yachiyo\Plus the three Arcana from the Visconti-Sforza version. An Arcana series original to the "Performance Festival," right?
Masai\That's right!
Yachiyo\But...
Yachiyo\The casting for the "Star" Arcana – it's still blank, right? What's the meaning...?
Masai\Oh, well...
Amemiya\We made it blank on purpose.
Amemiya\This play is an epic that transcends both time and place...
Amemiya\What the characters desire and what they're living for...
Amemiya\The "Star"... We want it to symbolize the thing, place, person – whatever people are aiming for.
Yachiyo\Oh, I see. That's why it's blank...
Yachiyo\I understand now.
Amemiya\Um... Many amazing performers have gathered together for this "Performance Festival".
Amemiya\So we'll make this script into one that will make sure each and every one of you can shine your very brightest.
Amemiya\Of course, everyone at Frontier too.
Masai\So, please look forward to the final draft!
Masai\Good work today!
All\Thank you!
Karen\Ahh, that was fun!
Hikari\Yes... It was.
Junna\Seriously. It was so intense you wouldn't have thought it was just a script reading.
Maya\It looked like Amemiya-san got a lot of inspiration too... I'm excited for the finished script.
Karen\Yeah!
Karen\But, oh... I wish they could've seen it. Today's improv and ad-lib battle.
Karen\—Everyone at Frontier.
Claudine\...I wonder if they're okay. It's the last script reading and none of them joined.
Maya\Ebisu-san contacted me and said they'll be fine and not to worry...
Claudine\I hope that's the case.
Karen\......
Karen\Aruru-chan.....
Maya\Let's just believe in them and wait.
Claudine\You're right. We felt their determination at the last script reading too.
Mahiru\I'm sure we'll all be on that stage together by the time the final draft is finished—
Akira\Final draft... huh.
Michiru\Well, the performance date is already set in stone, so it has to be finished.
Michiru\But... that script...
Akira\Michiru, you noticed too?
Michiru\Well, yes.
Michiru\"We want to make it into a story where everyone aims for their own 'Star'."
Michiru\I can understand how the script team feels, but...
Michiru\When "their own" stands out so much, the elements of an ensemble cast become stronger...
Akira\Without an axis to hold the play together—
Michiru\The link between the chapters become weak and it may end up giving off a vague impression?
Akira\Exactly.
Akira\To have all the performers on stage shine.
Akira\Of course, that would be ideal, but—
Michiru\It's necessary.
Akira\Yes, it's necessary.
Akira\The stage... It needs a strong existence that penetrates the center of the play, shines right in the middle of the stage...
Michiru\Rouses the creator, guides the performers, and captivates the audience.
