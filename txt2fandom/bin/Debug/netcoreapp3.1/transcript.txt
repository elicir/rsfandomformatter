{{CharTalk|Hikari|What if baseball girl Hikari Kagura said she wanted to go for a stroll around the neighborhood?}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|A short play that branches off from this themeâ€”}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Hikari-chan! Over here! Look at this!!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|What... is this? A small cat statue??}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|It's the mascot for this shopping district! Cute, right?}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...Mr. White is cuter.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Haha, don't say that. You should grow to like this cat too!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Because from now on, you'll be shopping here all the time.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Okay... I'll do my best.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Heh heh, hearing you say that makes me being your guide a worthwhile job... Oh!}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Oh, hello.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Hey, it's Karen and Kagura!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|What's the matter, you two?!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Nothing's the matter. Today is our turn to do the shopping.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Oh, right...}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|You're carrying a lot of stuff.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Yeah, we got a lot of freebies! Everyone's rooting for the Seisho baseball team.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|This happy weight is the expectations of the people in this shopping district.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|But it looks heavy... We'll help you carry some.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Yes, I can take that.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|C'est bon, this is nothing. Don't you know how much training I do?}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|But if you really want to help... Here, take this.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|This is...}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|"Ticket to Play"??}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|I got it when I was shopping. It's a ticket for a chance to win something at the giveaway over there.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Yeah, we've got our hands full, so why don't you two go and win something nice.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Oh, but this game...}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Exactly! So we're counting on you, Kagura.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Me?}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Yes. You're the only one we can count on.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Let's see, the game area is...}}
{{CharTalk|Booth Owner|Oh, if it isn't Karen-chan!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Hello!!}}
{{CharTalk|Booth Owner|Are you here to try the game? Oh, but Karen-chan...}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|That's been bugging me this whole time. Only I can be counted on...}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Why can't you play?}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Heh heh... Well as you can see, you knock down the prize you want in this game...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|When I did it before, I pretty much ended up hitting everything...!}}
{{CharTalk|Booth Owner|Haha! That's right. So Karen-chan got put into the hall of fame!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Oh, I get it now.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Yeah! So it's all on you, Hikari-chan!!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Okay... But it's quite far.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|The ball is a light bean bag. This will be tricky to control... Ah!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|W-What is it?!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|That's... a Mr. White beach ball...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|I've never seen that before. It must be a limited item only available in Japan...}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|I need that!!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|H-Hikari-chan, your eyes are on fire!!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|HAAAAH...!}}
{{CharTalk||*clang* *clang*}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Heh heh, it's so cute...!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Amazing! I can't believe you managed to hit one that was so far away!!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|I was able to introduce you to everyone in the shopping district today too. This is perfect...}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Oh...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Huh, what's wrong? Hikari-chan, why do you look so down?!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|This is the only prize I got.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|They asked me to get something good... But I only got something for myself...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Oh, wait a minute! Hikari-chan!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|What is it?}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|That Mr. White... It might not be a beach ball... Isn't it too big?}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|You're right... Let's see...}}
{{CharTalk||*rustle* *rustle*}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|It's an inflatable balance ball...!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Training equipment!!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Wow, that's great! Everyone can use this!!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|You're right... I was able to fulfill what was asked of me.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...But during the other times, can we keep this in our room?}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Haha, I'll ask everyone together with you!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|...This is wonderful, Hikari-chan!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Yeah...!}}
