{{CharTalk|Junna|...No matter how it turns out, this is it.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Oh, sorry...! Before we start the match, can I say something first?}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|What is it?}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Um, thank you for today!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|And... Sorry if I sound rude, but...}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|I won't give up! I'll show you the kind of baseball girl I am through this match!!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Hm... Sure. All right then...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Play ball!!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Hi-yah!}}
{{CharTalk||*CLINK*}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Over there, Hoshimi-san!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|What a shot! ...Oh no, she's not gonna make it!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Ngh!!}}
{{CharTalk||*slide*}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|No way, she caught it...!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Heh heh, it's hard to beat a person who never gives up...  A quote by Babe Ruth.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Argh... I thought it'd be a home run!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|No points since it was caught. Their movements have improved from last time.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Moreover, I can't read Karen's pitches! Is this...}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|The result of their special training?}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...That's not all there is to it.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|There's no holding back or hesitation in her lead. She can read what pitches everyone is bad at or excels at.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Hmm. Meaning something has changed with her?}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Looks like it. So this is what she meant...}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|This is Mahiru Tsuyuzaki's baseball girl!!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|All right, final inning and we're in the lead by 1 point...! Captain, Karen-han, we're counting on you. Don't let them hit it!}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Non! Not so fast. The bases are loaded.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|The next batter up is...}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|......}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Hikari-chan...!}}
{{CharTalk||*swish*}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...Come at me.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|HAAAH!}}
{{CharTalk||*CLINK*}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|She hit it?!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Wait, look at the ball!}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Yes, it's a foul.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|But look at how far it went. If she got the timing right, it might've been a long hit...!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|*huff* *huff*}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(Strike, strike, foul... Let's make the next pitch the last one, Karen-chan!)}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|(Okay... But based on the current flow, a straight pitch might let Hikari-chan hit!)}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|(So I should do a curve for the last one too...)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(You can't, Karen-chan! Kagura-san definitely knows how Karen-chan feels.)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(You mustn't throw a curve ball out of worry!)}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|(But...)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(Don't worry, I know you're an exceptional pitcher, that's why...)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(Let's win this together!!)}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|...!}}
{{CharTalk||*swish*}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|(She's winding up!!)}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|(That form... A straight pitch?!)}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|(Right in the center? Is she for real?!)}}
{{CharTalk||*THWAP*}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|S-Strike...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Batter out...!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|It's over!!}}
{{CharTalk|All|Whoa...!!!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|You did it! Congrats!!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Hey, we're your opponents. You shouldn't be congratulating us.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Heh heh yeah, but...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Yeah! That was so fun!!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Thank you... It's all thanks to everyone...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|You don't need to thank us.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|We did it for ourselves... We showed brilliance for the team.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...I'll accept the result of today's match, but I have no intention of losing.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|I haven't given up on being the catcher... being Karen's catcher.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Heh heh, bring it on!}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Then are we good?}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|I want to start practice already. Look out on the field... The first years are waiting.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Oh...!!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|She's right... Captain?}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Okay! Gather 'round...!!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Junna|(The hot, melting sun beams down.)}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|(Burning heat that makes it difficult to breathe.)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(Our overflowing feelings are all sucked up by the field, becoming one...)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru & Hikari & https://karth.top/costume/101008?type=dlc |(That's right. The field "you" stand on is where I belong...)}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Andrew|...Hm. This is such a hot and sweaty script!}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Andrew, here's a handkerchief for your tears.}}
{{CharTalk|Andrew|*sniff* Ahem... I could be the baseball mascot at the very least for the next professional baseball piece!}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Heh heh, a new story like that might exist somewhere.}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Stage girls who compete for one thing have become baseball girls who fight to become one...}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|With everything combined, this signals the end of this play.}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Everyone, please be careful on your way back...}}
