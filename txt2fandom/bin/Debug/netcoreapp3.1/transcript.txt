{{CharTalk|Maya|"Is that...the so-called 'Paradise' you are trying to create...?"}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|"Clever... And you intend on taking all of that — 'Emperor'!"}}
{{CharTalk|Akira|"Of course! Everything in this 'World' belongs to me – it's the core of the truth, the laws of nature!"}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|"My... How arrogant..."}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|"Power is violence... And just like this... Us powerless 'Lovers' will be torn apart."}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|"One day, 'Judgement' will fall upon this foolish decision."}}
{{CharTalk|Akira|"That's preposterous! I do not fear 'Judgement'!"}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|"Yes, that's you. Just what is 'Justice'—"}}
{{CharTalk|Akira|"I make the call."}}
{{CharTalk|Akira|"I fear nothing. If I were to fear... It would be falling down halfway through my supremacy..."}}
{{CharTalk|Akira|"I...will definitely make it. I'll take down anything and everything that stands in my way!"}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|"Wonderful... How wonderful! That is what makes you mortal!"}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|"So will the 'Emperor' change fate with that strong will...or burn out in regret..."}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|"I'll watch on until the very end... Without a doubt, as 'Death'."}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|"All right... Then let us wait at the 'World's' end. That time shall come before long—"}}
{{CharTalk|Masai|And, scene. Thank you.}}
{{CharTalk|Akira|Huff, huff...}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Phew... Good work, Yukishiro-san.}}
{{CharTalk|Akira|Huff... Standing on the same stage as everyone, I can't afford to cut corners even when it comes to practices. }}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Now, there's no need to be so modest.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|It was just like that of an actual performance. Enough to overpower everyone else.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|"That's preposterous!"}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|That adlib... I could envision the "Emperor" with that one line, it was very much in-character.}}
{{CharTalk|Akira|It's an honor to be told that by you, Maya Tendo.}}
{{CharTalk|Akira|But if you're talking about adlibs, Tomoe too.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|...Huh?}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|That line in the beginning.}}
{{CharTalk|Akira|Kocho, you noticed?}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|The original line was "Without a doubt, as 'Death'... I'll watch on until the very end".}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|The order was swapped.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|That's right, Daiba-san. I thought putting "Death" at the end would give it a greater impact.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|...So you changed it last minute.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Yeah. Right before you said the line... A split-second decision.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|They said it's fine for us to act freely... I got swept along by everyone's acting and couldn't help myself.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|...It was splendid.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|To be praised by Maya Tendo... It's an honor.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|But Kocho-san too.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Huh?}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|"How arrogant...".}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|I could sense the sadness and powerlessness from your acting, all the way to your fingertips...}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|I'm going to learn a lot from you from now on.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Oh, uh, okay...}}
{{CharTalk|Masai|Let's end today's script reading here!}}
{{CharTalk|Masai|We'd assigned the difficult task of not sharing your roles with anyone else before the initial read-over...}}
{{CharTalk|Masai|But thanks to that, we've gotten a lot of great inspiration.}}
{{CharTalk|Amemiya|Thank you, everyone... It's all thanks to your acting that each role feels like it's come alive.}}
{{CharTalk|Amemiya|The script team will now re-work the script once more based on the acting you've just shown us.}}
{{CharTalk|Masai|It's possible that the contents and composition for all six acts might turn out completely different...}}
{{CharTalk|Masai|We'll make this stage better and better in time for the "Performance Festival"!}}
{{CharTalk|Akira|I look forward to it.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|I can't wait.}}
{{CharTalk|Masai|Then this marks the end of the first "Performance Festival" script reading. Good work, everyone!}}
{{CharTalk|All|Good work!}}

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;" >Part 2</span>
{{CharTalk|Karen|Wow, that was so great!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Yeah! It was!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Tendo-san's lightning collided with Yukishiro-san's thunder...}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Shizuha-chan's gradual pace was enhanced by Tamao-chan's brisk pace...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Everyone's brilliance was shining so brightly!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Like... How a fluffy shape turns round!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|The tingles...}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|The excitement...}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|It's too much!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Too much!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...Stage-crazies.}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|...Yep, stage-crazies.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Oh, don't talk like that, you two.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Yeah, Misora! How could you say that?!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Yeah, Hikari-chan, you meanie!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|That wasn't mean at all!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Huh!?}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|I understand feeling excited after the first script reading...}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|But don't shout so loudly in the middle of the street!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen & Aruru|...!!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Both of you already have loud voices to begin with. Look, the people walking around us are staring.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen & Aruru|We're sorry.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...Mahiru's voice just now was loud too.}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|It was loud... wasn't it.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|What?! Oh... I-I'm sorry!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Heh heh, so you're excited too, Mahiru-chan!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|N-no...}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Well... I guess you're not wrong.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|...Today's script reading was really stimulating.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen & Aruru|Right? Right!?}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Yes. I got goosebumps too.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|All the talented performers gathered together on one stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Colliding to complete an unfinished story...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Yes, exactly!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|That's what I wanted to say!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|It feels like something new... A stage is being created.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Nervousness and anticipation... I can see the shimmering within the tingling...}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|It's...nice.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen & Aruru|Yes, nice!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Wow... Kagura-san. You could understand Aruru's "Aruru lingo" completely...}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Probably because she's used to Karen-chan.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Oh... Everyone, be quiet!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|We're speaking loudly and getting looks again...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen & Aruru & Hikari|Oh...}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|At this rate, we're all stage-crazies.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|"That's preposterous! We do not fear being crazies!"}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Huh... Oh, Kocho-san!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Hello, Shizuha-senpai!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|I'm sorry, it took me a while to shower.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Shizuha-chan, you were great. That "Judgement" role was fantastic!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|You had such intense ads with Tendo-san and Yukishiro-san!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Ads...?}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|I think she's talking about the ad-lib exchange.}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Oh, I see!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|It's only because Tendo-san and Yukishiro-san led the scene so well... And Tomoe-san too.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|It looks like it's still going to take me a while to fully immerse myself into the role. I want to hurry back and practice.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Whoa, we've found another stage-crazy here!!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Then let's go home. Back to Frontier.}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|See you, Aijo-san, Kagura-san, Tsuyuzaki-san!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|See you at the next practice.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Yes, see you next time!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|See ya!}}

Part 3=
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;" >Curtain Rises - The Journey Begins</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;" >Part 3</span>
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Ah, that was fun. I can't wait for the next practice!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Aruru, you kept stumbling over your lines today.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Ngh... We were surrounded by all these amazing people, so I only got a little nervous!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Well, I guess so. I was nervous too.}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|I never thought I'd get to practice with the renowned Claudine Saijo-san. Never could've imagined that.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Right. Clau-chan has been performing on stage for a long time!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Of course I'd get nervous.}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|And it's also my first time to stand on a stage as big as the Toho Art Theater!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Yeah. I'm really glad we got chosen for the "Performance Festival"!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|But... I only realized after I stood on the stage with everyone for practice...}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Huh? What?}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|...That it's scary.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Huh? Scary? What is?}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Misora-chan...}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Don't worry, it's fine! There's nothing to be afraid of!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|A gigantic stage and amazing people! It's such an exciting stage!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|We're gonna watch everyone's acting and learn a lot.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|We'll definitely be able to create the most fun and happy stage together with everyone in the "Performance Festival"!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Fun and...happy stage...?}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Shizuha-chan?}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Aruru-chan... Do you really think that?}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Huh...?}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Shizuha-senpai...}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Aruru-chan. The "Performance Festival"... That stage—}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|(There's no lead role, that's why it's a hell where performers battle it out for the lead position.)}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Nana|Whew...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Here you go, Nana. "Banana Milk".}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Oh... Thanks, Junna-chan.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Phew... Script reading from morning till now sure is exhausting.}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Yeah. But...it's a nice kind of tired where it feels like the stage has really begun.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Yeah, you're right.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Then here's to finishing the first "Performance Festival" script reading.}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|With "Banana Milk" and "Strawberry Milk".}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Heh heh.}}
{{CharTalk|Nana & Junna|Good work.}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Mmm... Delicious.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|I can finally relax.}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Yeah. The "Performance Festival" rehearsal room had such a tense atmosphere.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Well, that's because today was the first time for all the participating schools to gather.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|And on top of that, a sudden etude with our given roles?! Of course we'd be nervous!}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Haha, you're right.}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Masai-san and Amemiya-san said it too, but...}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Thanks to everyone's performance, I can clearly see the outline for all the characters.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|That's true.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Even though the "World" Arcana doesn't have a particular concept...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Seeing Tendo-san's performance and hearing her lines, really brought the "role" to life.}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Yeah. The one who brought that out was...Yukishiro-san's "Emperor".}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|The human-like "Emperor" covered in selfish desires was a great comparison against Tendo-san's detached role.}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|And also... The story's trickster, "Death".}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Yeah! "Death"!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|It felt like that role had such a huge range of possibilities with Tomoe-san's acting.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|I was really surprised to see that kind of acting from her.}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Yeah, me too.}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|The acting was really well done and it caught everyone's attention.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Yeah... It was really inspirational.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Yours too, Nana.}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Huh?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|You held your own against Tendo-san, Yukishiro-san, Kocho-san, and Tomoe-san.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|I won't lose either.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Since I'm standing on the same stage with all these talented people.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|In order to make this stage a success... I'll give my all to the role I've been given.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Just watch, Nana! I'll give the best performance with my "High Priestess"!}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Junna-chan...}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|...Yes.}}

{{CharTalk|Futaba|Kaoruko! Ka-o-ru-ko!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|What are you mad about?}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|I'm not mad or anything.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|You only walk that fast when you're mad.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Uh...}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Why did you say you're going back to the academy all of a sudden?}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|...It's nothing.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|I'm just... I just feel frustrated for some reason.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Frustrated...}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Oh, we can't have that.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Why don't you have some sweets and take a breather, Hanayagi-san?}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Tamao-han...}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|There's a place nearby with delicious pancakes.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|They closed shop once because they gave out too many freebies, but they got a lot of support and have re-opened.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Shall we go together? Isurugi-san too.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|I-It's okay...}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|You two should go. I'm busy. Bye.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Is this for..."role preparations'?}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|...!}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Thank goodness... I'm glad it looks like it got across with my acting.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Got across... What are you talking about?}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|...Hanayagi-san's "Devil"... It was really charming.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|It was adorable and attractive... Very sweet.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|...!?}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|My "Death" is like an ode in reply to Hanayagi-san's acting...}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Ode in reply...? It wasn't so elegant.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|That's... Yes. ...A "declaration of war".}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Huh...}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Exactly right, Hanayagi--san. As you'd expect.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|As I'm sure you're aware, our Rinmeikan Girls School Performance Department has disbanded and narrowly escaped death by becoming the Performance Association.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|And this "Performance Festival" that we've been given...is the best stage to light our flame of life with.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Light your...flame of life?}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|—The revival of the Rinmeikan Girls School Performance Department.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba & Kaoruko|...!}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Seisho Music Academy, Siegfeld Institute of Music, Frontier School of Arts...}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Take down all the powerful schools present and then our Rinmeikan Performance Association will release the best brilliance—}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|And beyond that light, the Rinmeikan Girls School Performance Department will rise. I'm sure of it.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|We have nothing to lose. This stage is the beacon of our revival.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|The lead of the "Performance Festival" is ours. I just wanted to tell you that.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Tomoe... You...}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|So please hurry and catch up without losing to anyone.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Until the day when you fight with me comes, Kaoruko Hanayagi-san.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Tamao... Tomoe...!}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Excuse me... Goodbye.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|......}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|......}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Tomoe sure has changed.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|...Pfft.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Kaoruko?}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Catch up...she said.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|That girl who has never once won against me in dance... Sounds like she's taking me lightly.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|...We're going home, Futaba-han.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Huh?}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|...I'll accept this declaration of war.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Just like a lot has happened to her, I'm also no longer the girl she thinks I am.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|I'll show her...just who the lead of this stage is... Right?}}

<hr>
{{CharTalk|Andrew|The one who shows the most brilliant Revue and lights the fire in the young girl's heart...}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|—Will be on the path to become the "Unknown Lead".}}
{{CharTalk|Elle & Andrew|Revue has begun.}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Junna|People have stars they're destined for.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Glittering stars, morning stars, shooting stars.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Even if I can't see my star, I'll look up from this day on.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Junna Hoshimi, 99th Class! I'll take hold of a star of my own!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Dancing and singing back and forth, fighting desperately day after day.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Crossing swords on stage once more. The blooming of young blood at their best.}}

<hr>
{{CharTalk|Junna & Kaoruko|Haaaah!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|"Timeless Play"... "Unknown Lead"...}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|What's with all the vague words and stuff?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|True. But...those were some exciting words!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Right now, it's just a play without a single line... But in the center of that stage...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Yes, the "Unknown Lead"!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Huh. So you're saying you can see it?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Yes, I can for sure!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|What's needed in order to be able to stand on that stage—}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|What is needed to ensure this uncertain future— It's the "present"!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Ngh...!}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Amazing...!}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Both of them... Beautiful and cool... They're shining.}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|......}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Hey, Andrew. My heart's racing for some reason...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|"What win I, if I gain the thing I seek?  A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy."}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|William Shakespeare's words.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Fix your eyes on the future and carry out the role you've been given on the existing stage!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|What I'm accumulating "now" will lead me to the "Unknown Lead" of the unseen future!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|I'll become it – for sure.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|I will be the "Unknown Lead"!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Junna|...?! My arrow's been cut down?!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|...Pardon me, Hoshimi-han.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|?!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Unlike you, I can't take such vague things as the truth...}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|We know nothing about this "Unknown Lead".}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|But...}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|I'm not gonna lose.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|...!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|A good child who's always been an annoyance of mine...suddenly bared her teeth and bit me.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|I thought she would always just be chasing after me... But she...}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Ahh... This is so annoying...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|What... What are you talking about?}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|I'm just talking to myself.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|"Timeless Play"... "Unknown Lead"...}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Pardon me, Hoshimi-han.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Either way works for me... I don't really care.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|You don't...care...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Ngh...!?}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|I won't be able to forgive myself...}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|If the girl who I thought would always be chasing after me...surpasses me and becomes the "Unknown Lead"...}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|That's just...}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|I definitely won't allow that!!}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|"That's the only thing..."}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|"The only thing that I definitely won't allow"...}}

{{CharTalk|Rui|Ms. Ukaji, this is...!}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|Exactly – it's the costume for the "Performance Festival".}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|That said, it's just the one I made for rehearsals...}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|It doesn't even come close to the quality of the ones the costume team makes.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh...?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Are you telling me that you made this...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|Yeah, I wanted to help even if just a little.}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|So I asked the festival organizers if I could copy the costume paper pattern.}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|I thought that if you could wear this, you'd feel closer to the real performance.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Th-Thank you very much, Ms. Ukaji!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Wow, the quality of the collar and cuffs... This is just like the real deal!}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|Thank you. You're too kind...}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|I was a student at Rinmeikan too, so I know my way around cooking, cleaning and sewing.}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|I used to be known as "Seamstress Masako" in my days.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|"Seamstress Masako"... That's a beautiful nickname.}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|T-That was a long time ago.}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|Well, these are all the costumes for the rehearsals. Can you hand them over to everyone?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh? I-I couldn't possibly rob you of that role!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I'm sure everyone will be ecstatic to be able to practice wearing the costumes you made!}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|Everyone's busy rehearsing for the "Performance Festival" now. The script reading sessions have begun as well.}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|I'm happy supporting you all from the backstage. There's no need to worry about me.}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|So, please?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Ms. Ukaji...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I got it. You can count on me to deliver them.}}
{{CharTalk|Ukaji|Have a great rehearsal, Akikaze-san. I hope everyone does their best too.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Yes, I'll do my best!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Rui|Hm?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Where are Fumi-senpai and Ichie-senpai? They are nowhere on campus...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I can't wait to hand them their costumes...}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Tamao|'''("Death")'''<br>"Wonderful! How wonderful! That is what makes you mortal!"}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Hmm...}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|'''("Death")'''<br>"Wonderful... How wonderful. That is what makes you mortal..."}}
{{CharTalk||*clap clap clap*}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|T-Tamao-senpai is amazing.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Her lines as "Death" just now... So frightening, so cold... I got goosebumps.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|She's improved even more since the script reading...}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|...Oh, hi, Rui-chan. I didn't see you there. What's the matter?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Eek! Ah, yes!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|This... This is for you, Tamao-senpai. It's the costume for rehearsals.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Costume for rehearsals...?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Ms. Ukaji made it using the paper pattern from the stage costume.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|She said it might help making you feel closer to the actual performance.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Ms. Ukaji did this...?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Her eyes were slightly red too... She must have worked overnight to make it.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|...}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Thanks, Rui-chan. Please put it over there.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|I'll wear it in a short while. I'd like to continue practicing a bit longer.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh? Ah, yes.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|If that's okay, I'll help you practice!}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|...Rui-chan.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|I appreciate the gesture, but there's nothing you can do to help me.}}
{{CharTalk|Tamao|Besides, I'm sure you have things to do in preparation for the "Performance Festival" too.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Ah...yes.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I-I'll let you practice then.}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Rui|...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Tamao-senpai...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|She was so focused that I could feel the pressure all around her...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Hmm... It almost felt like she was out for blood...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Oh, Rui.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Yukko! Where did you go?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|I had minor business to attend to. Huh? What's that costume?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh? Oh, this is...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Rui... Did something happen?}}

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;" >Part 7</span>
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Woah, Ms. Ukaji made it?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Yeah. She got the paper pattern from the organizers of the "Performance Festival"...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Her eyes were red, so I'm sure she stayed up all night making our costumes...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|But...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Tamao-senpai reacted so coldly.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|......}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I also can't find Fumi-senpai and Ichie-senpai either...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|We're scattered around even at such an important time as this...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|"Scattered around"...?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Rui... Do you really think that?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|What are your feelings toward the "Performance Festival"?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|My feelings...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I feel honored to have been chosen as a part of the cast...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Standing on the same stage as Tamao-senpai means that I cannot allow any mistakes in my acting.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Is that all?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh...? What are you hinting at, Yukko?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|The first day of the script reading...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Tamao-senpai went over to Kaoruko-san and the girls from Seisho.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Tamao-senpai went to see Hanayagi-san?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Yeah. And what do you think they talked about?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh...?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Tamao-senpai, Kaoruko-san, and Futaba-san all learned traditional Japanese Senka-ryu dance from the same teacher...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Having shared that experience, they now find themselves on the same "Performance Festival" stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I'm sure they each have fond memories, so they probably talked about that when they met...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|......}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Heh heh... Ahaha!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|You never fail to amuse me...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|You're truly a kind person, Rui.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh...?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|How long were you planning on fooling yourself with that?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh...?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|The "Performance Festival" is our – Rinmeikan Performance Association's battle. It's already started, Rui.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Tamao-senpai...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|She went over to declare war.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Declare...war?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|"Take down all the powerful schools present and then our Rinmeikan Performance Association will release the best brilliance—"}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|"The lead of the "Performance Festival" is ours."}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|This is what Tamao-senpai said.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|She said that...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|She did... She's prepared for it. And so are Fumi-senpai and Ichie-san.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Didn't you feel anything during the script reading?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Didn't you see her eyes, her expression, her voice, her acting... her resolution?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|She lunged at everyone – all the talented actors – with her acting during the reading...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|She's prepared to attack everyone and stop their breath with her performance in order to become the lead in the "Performance Festival".}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Even if it means fighting with the members of her own Performance Association...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|...!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|That's why no one is practicing with one another.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|The time to be chummy is gone. It's time to polish your skills and be assertive.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Did you really think she went over there to talk about the good old days? Our seniors have grown.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Is that why she acted so coldly when I said I'd practice with her...?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I get it, but...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|If that's how she really feels, why didn't she tell me?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|...It's too late for that.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Don't be spoiled. No one, not even I, can allow themselves to help each other.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|...!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|"There's nothing you can do to help me"...!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|...That's what she said to you...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|It means that the way you are now, you're of no help to her.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|That's...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Tamao-senpai can be very strict. It's like she's "Death" itself.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|......}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|There's a story called "Shinigami", meaning "Death", in rakugo...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|If you see Death sitting next to a sick man, it means that man hasn't much time left to live.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|You remind me of the sick man.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|If you're not ready to defeat the other performers...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|You'll die in vain on the stage. You have no right to carry the honor of Rinmeikan nor to stand on the stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|So, please...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Consider this warning my final notice, Rui Akikaze.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Yukko...!}}

{{CharTalk|Elle|Revue...}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|A spellbinding performance conjured out of song and dance...}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Andrew|The one who shows the most brilliant Revue and lights the fire in the young girl's heart...}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|—Will be on the path to become the "Unknown Lead".}}
{{CharTalk|Elle & Andrew|Revue has begun.}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|One — Feelings hidden within ourselves. Two — The stage brought them together.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Three — For our future play. Four — I will show you the strength of traditional theater!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Rinmeikan Performance Association – Yuyuko Tanaka! I will put my life on the line!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Rui|Drawn by a distant pearl, I rested my blade.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Distance awakens me. I draw my blade and run to you.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Rinmeikan Performance Association – Rui Akikaze! My life is on this stage!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Rui|Yukko...!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|......}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|"Timeless Play"...}}
{{CharTalk|Andrew|Struggling for the "Unknown Lead"—}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Sing.}}
{{CharTalk|Andrew|And dance.}}
{{CharTalk|Elle & Andrew|Battle for brilliance.}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Hah!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Ngh!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|You're lacking power in your moves. You're wavering.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Yukko...!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|This Revue is for the "Unknown Lead"... This isn't the place for people who are unsure about standing on the stage!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Ngh! Yukko... What about you?!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Do you want to be the "Unknow Lead"?! Do you have a reason for it?!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Of course. Because I want to complete the "Timeless Play".}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|I'm sure our seniors feel the same way.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|The closure of the Rinmeikan Girls School Performance Department... It must've been even more painful for our seniors to lose something this important to us.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Something that will never disappear, never die. To engrave our own existence on the stage...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|To challenge...the "Timeless Play".}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|But the stage is alive...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|We don't know if Tamao-senpai and the others will be able to revive the Performance Department.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Y-Yukko!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|I'm just saying it's a possibility.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|In which case... Are you planning on saying goodbye to your dreams together with our seniors?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh...?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|No, right?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|We take over...the dream of reviving Rinmeikan's Performance Department.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Take...over...?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|We must be the ones to shoulder it – Tamao-senpai, Fumi-senpai, and Ichie-san's wish.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|...!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Our seniors have already been shouldering this dream. That's why they can't afford to carry you too.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|The way you rely on Tamao-senpai now—!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|T-That's impossible! Because...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Because... We're still just first years!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|The dream of reviving Rinmeikan's Performance Department... That burden is too much for me!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Rui...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|If it's a stage without Tamao-senpai, I...!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I mean, I got onto the stage to chase after Tamao-senpai. I only seriously started doing theater after joining the school...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|So?}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|...Do you know about Seisho's Banana-san?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|...What about Daiba-san?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|She didn't really start standing on the stage until after she'd entered Seisho Music Academy.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|What...? She didn't...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Blessed with an athletic body and long limbs. Height that makes everyone envious...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Rui... You have something that everyone wants, but could never have.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Yet...you only act spoiled.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Tamao-senpai will graduate one day and then it'll be your turn to be a senior.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|When Tamao-senpai is gone, who will you be?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|When there's no one else to call you "Rui-chan", who will you become?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Ngh...!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|*huff*... *huff*...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|So... this is...Yukko's determination...}}

{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Let's end this. Those who don't belong here should get off the stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|N-No... Don't make me go...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Don't leave me behind...Tamao-senpai!}}
<hr>
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|......}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|...Ugh, this is annoying...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|I'm the one who's standing on the stage with you right now.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh...?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|You see... I like your acting.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|It's clumsy and pure... But you always try your hardest and occasionally appear really big...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Just like you love Tamao-senpai...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|I also love you on stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Kichi Miroku, Onikage, Urashima Taro, Nightingale, all of them...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Those roles all happened because of you, Rui Akikaze. All my favorite characters.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Yet... You say you can no longer play those roles without Tamao-senpai. If those performances were all done for Tamao-senpai...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Those of "us" who have had our hearts stolen by the Stage Girl Rui Akikaze... How pathetic.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Yuk...ko... Are you crying...?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|...Oh, can't have that. I let my emotions get the best of me.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|It's time to end this. We can't have someone who doesn't belong remain on this stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|As you are right now you're not able to shoulder the Rinmeikan Performance Association with me.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|I can't move forward either.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|If you're the "Rui-chan" who can't perform by yourself, then—!!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Rui|...I won't quit.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|...I'm not quitting.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|......}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Just like you said... For me, the stage is Tamao-senpai.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|But if I quit... I won't be able to stand on that stage again.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I... I don't want that!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|...!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I entered this world because I admire Tamao-senpai! I chased after her and have come this far!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|And... It taught me about the fun, intensity, and enjoyment that is the stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|The excitement that comes from becoming someone that isn't yourself.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|The joy from creating something together with everyone. The cheers and overflow of applause from those who support us—!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Now that I know all about that, there's no way I could step down from this stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I can't do it, Yukko!}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|......}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|"...Now that I know."}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|"I can no longer pretend that I don't."}}
{{CharTalk|Andrew|Elle...!}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|The stage girls' Revue has lit the fire... A story is being born within the young girl—!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Haha, looks like you've finally mustered up the determination.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|There's no way you could step down... Are you being serious?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I'm serious!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Even if Tamao-senpai is gone?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Even when...Tamao-senpai is gone!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Even if aiming for the "Unknown Lead"... means you may have to fight Tamao-senpai one day?}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|......!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Fight Tamao-senpai...one day...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Even if I have to fight Tamao-senpai!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Rui|*huff*... *huff*...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|..."Position Zero".}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh? Oh...!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|P-Position Zero!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Heh heh.}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|The brilliance from the stage girls brought out fragments of plays...}}
{{CharTalk|Andrew|This is..."Creation" and "Sacrifice".}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Yes.}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|The "Revue of Creation and Sacrifice" is over.}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Phew... My words finally got across.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Now I can move forward too.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Yukko... What are you...?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|I just have some minor business to take care of. I told you, didn't I? I want to complete the "Timeless Play".}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Then... Is that the reason why you were riling me up...?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|No, don't even try to think that I was holding back or lost on purpose.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|This was a result of us singing, dancing, and battling with all our might.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Yukko...}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Oh, and one more thing.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|"Ajara kamokuren Ruruiruirui Tekerettsunopaa."}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Huh? What?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|It's a spell from the "Shinigami" rakugo to ward off Death.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Now you won't lose. To anyone – not even "Death".}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Yukko...}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|But... I'm not sure if I'll be able to fight properly...against "Death".}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Well, people don't change so easily. So you wouldn't be able to leave Tamao-senpai's side so easily either.}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|So all you can do is to start with what you're able to do now.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|What I'm able to do... Tamao-senpai said that to me too.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|...I'll give it a try.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|First, I've gotta catch up. Just like the Laelaps hound!}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|But then that's no different from the old Rui.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|People don't change so easily... Right?}}
{{CharTalk|Yuyuko|Well, well. I guess that's it for me.}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|Heh heh... Thanks, Yukko!}}
{{CharTalk|Rui|I'll give it a shot. I'll put in all my feelings towards Tamao-senpai!}}

{{CharTalk|Girl|...With who?}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|I don't know...but I told "them".}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|'I'll be waiting. At the end of the moonlight... At the promised place – the secret paradise.'}}

{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Oh... You're awake."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|When I wake up again, I see a gentle smile.}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"Where am I...?"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"This is my clinic. You passed out on the outskirts of town."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"You were plagued by the disease for three days and three nights... But it looks like the worst has passed. I'm glad the medicine worked."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"You're the one who saved me..."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Aw, shucks. It's a doctor's job to save people."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"What's your name? Why were you passed out in such a place?"}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"...I don't know."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"You don't know?"}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"Yes... My name, where I came from, where I'm supposed to go..."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"You don't know? Could it be the high fever you had from the disease has affected your memory somehow...?"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"If you've lost your memory, then this is a new discovery! I must investigate this further... Oh."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"S-Sorry. When I start thinking about illnesses, I get very excited..."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"What a troublesome disease."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"Heh heh."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Oh, you finally laughed. Looks like you might be able to have some soup for dinner at least."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"Um... Can I ask you something?"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"What is it?"}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"This disease you've been talking about..."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Oh, I'm talking about 'delusional fever'."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"An epidemic that started spreading like wildfire a few months ago. It's a terrifying disease that causes high fevers. Some patients don't wake up from it and pass away."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"Delusional fever..."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"People call it an uncurable illness... I lost my father, mother, and sister, to this disease."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"...!"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"After that, I dedicated all my time to researching this disease...and managed to make a specific medicine for it."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"So then... In order to save people who are suffering from this disease, I've been traveling all over the nation."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"That's how I found you."}}

{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Who is it?"}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"It's me, Your Eminence."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Oh, Magician. Come in."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"Excuse me."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"The doctor has been detained in the underground prison."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"The sentence will be executed tomorrow morning without delay—"}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Good."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"Medicine is a miracle that can be seen by the eye. It violates and denies the work of God."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"Those who cast doubt on Your Eminence's authority..."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Oh my... Are you going to treat me like a barbarian too? A philistine who's filled with suspicions and clings to the Vatican's authority?"}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"Not at all."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"I'm merely trying to fulfil my role as Your Eminence's aide."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"That's fine."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Then, I shall also fulfill my role."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Eradicating the disease and saving man from death is a miracle of God. Only faith in God can save man."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Other possibilities... Other values... It only weakens one's loyalty to God."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Any possibility of salvation that's not faith... It can only be whisperings of the devil."}}

{{CharTalk|Magician|"Most certainly."}}

{{CharTalk|Magician|"How about another glass of red wine to celebrate. This is the finest wine, granted by the His Holiness."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"...Yes, let's."}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Girl|At that time, the doctor was in prison.}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Ugh... Open this! Open this door!"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"There are many patients with delusional fever who need my medicine! There are lives that can be saved!"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Is God's influence more important than those who are dying?! Answer me, High Priestess!"}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"...Your abuse just now is lese majesty and has just earned you another 50 years to your sentence."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"But I suppose it carries no meaning for one who is to be hanged tomorrow."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"...?! Who is it?"}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"...The sham Magician hired by the High Priestess."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"...What did you just say? Tomorrow morning, I will..."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"That's right. You are to be hanged and burned at the stake for the crime of defiling God's influence."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Ridiculous... This is all ridiculous. It's all a tasteless farce!"}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"It's meaningless to shout. Her Eminence has had a great deal of wine and is asleep."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Are you messing with me?!"}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"..."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"Doctor... So you don't want to die?"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"What? Of course I don't."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"But I'm not afraid of death. If I were, I wouldn't be able to treat delusional fever."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"If I die, so will those lives that could be saved. To have my ambition fall through... That's what's regrettable."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"..."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"You're right, this is a farce. This story has been decided a long time ago..."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"But... What if it could be changed?"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"...What?"}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"You'll be the main character of this farce."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"In exchange, you'll be cursed."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"Happiness as a person, joy... Throw all of that away and you'll be able to walk down an even harsher path as the main character."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"What do you say? Do you have the determination to go down that path?"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"...Determination, you say?"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"...I've had it long before I'd started walking down this path."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"...That's fine."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"..."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"—You simply need to yell the words I've just said. The moment death approaches."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"Whether or not you choose to believe me... Whether you'll become the main character – it all depends on you."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"...Why?"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Why...would you do this for me?"}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"..."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"I've also made up my mind—"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"..."}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Girl|And then morning came. The morning where the hanged doctor is to be executed.}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Now is the time to test your faith in God!"}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"The delusional fever not subsiding is evidence of your wavering faith and loyalty..."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"And the one who used dubious tricks to cast doubt in the people's hearts...is this 'Hanged Man'."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Now, throw rocks at and set fire to this 'Hanged Man'."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Then your faith will be reignited and your loyalty will become steadfast!"}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"Please stop!"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"...!"}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"Why would you do such a terrible thing?! That man saved my life!"}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"Many other people have also been saved by him... So... Why?!"}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"Young girl, step back. It's dangerous here."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"But...!"}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"Believe. Not in God...but in him."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"Huh?"}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Now, let's begin."}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Girl|I try to stand my ground, but I am pushed away by the crowd and a fire is lit by his feet.}}

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;" >Part 12</span>
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Now, repent in the flames."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Only the miracle of God can save man. Those who deny that are nothing but a criminal."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"If you aren't a criminal, then God would save you."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"But... You're saying that my being burned is evidence that I'm a criminal?"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"A farce. This is all a farce. Ngh... Ahhhhh!"}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"No. That flame is the reality. The flame is the truth."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"There is no other miracle that can save man except for faith."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"...No."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"It is people...who save people."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Even in despair and shattered, I still shoulder the responsibility and go down the path I believe in. Only a person's belief can bring light to people."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"You're wrong! Those are words of the devil! Everyone, you mustn't listen to him!"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Deny it all you want, but whether or not this path leads to Hell—"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"I...am not going to stop walking!!"}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Magician|"Yes... Those words..."}}
{{CharTalk|Magician|"You are the main character – 'Hanged Man'..."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|After saying those words, the Magician collapses.
And then—}}
{{CharTalk||*thump* *thump*}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"'Not going to stop walking'..."}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"—'The show must go on.'"}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"I've heard you loud and clear. Here's the contract!"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"W-What is this black shadow—"}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"The Devil has come to save you, 'Hanged Man'."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"The Devil? Me?! Why?!"}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"Why? Because you said the oath."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"'Not going to stop walking'...!"}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"Correct. And a soul has been used for the exchange. All that's left is to fulfill the contract."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Soul...?"}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"Oh... Yeah, that Magician's soul."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"What?!"}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"One of the delusional fever patients you saved around two months ago... The redheaded young girl."}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"That was the magician's granddaughter."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"...!"}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"The magician knew while serving the High Priestess that the skill of man is what can save people."}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"That's why she struck a deal with me. To save the Hanged Man in exchange for her life..."}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"To change this world."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"...!"}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"Heh heh... To think the sham Magician's last act is to call upon the Devil using real magic. How clever."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"You... Magician, how could you betray me at the last moment...!"}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Devil, begone!"}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"Oh, who should be the one to leave? High Priestess."}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"The freed 'Hanged Man' uses his skills to save the people, meaning the values will change."}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"You gather faith through fear of burning at the stake and boast that only God can save man. High Priestess, your services are no longer needed."}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"If you've finished playing your role... It's time for you to step off the stage."}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"Eek... G-Get away from me, Devil! S-Someone, save me!"}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"Aren't you the one who hanged those who begged for their lives in the name of God, and burned them at the stake?"}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"Now it's your turn to dance as the criminal. On the stage of Hell, forevermore—"}}
{{CharTalk|High Priestess|"No... No.... Ahhhhhh!"}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Devil|"'Hanged Man', our contract has been fulfilled."}}
{{CharTalk|Devil|"Let's meet again in Hell when you have fulfilled your role one day."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Yes... I'm grateful for your help, Devil."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|I thought it was enveloped in flames, but before I knew it, the High Priestess and Vatican knights had all disappeared.}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|The Devil must have taken them to Hell.}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|And that's how the doctor...the "Hanged Man" was saved.}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"A life saved by the Devil... My role as the main character..."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Create an era with no God, destined to face challenges – this IS a curse."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"...No."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"That's definitely...a promise."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"I think it's a 'promise' with someone dear to you."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Promise... I see, a promise."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"...It's gonna get busy."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"I was given this life at the expense of the Magician, so I must save as many people as I can."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Would you be willing to lend me a hand?"}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"Huh?"}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"If you continue on this journey to save people, you may be able to find your memories some day..."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"I'm sorry...I have to go. To the promised place."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Huh?"}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"'I'll be waiting. At the end of the moonlight... At that promised place – the secret paradise.' ...That's the promise I made."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"...I see."}}
{{CharTalk|Doctor|"Have a safe journey. Don't push yourself too hard."}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"Thank you. I definitely won't let this life that you've saved go to waste."}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Girl|With that, I part ways with the doctor and continue on my journey.}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|The journey to an unknown place where someone is waiting for me.}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|But the person I met taught me this—}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|Even if this path leads to Hell—}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Doctor|I...am not going to stop walking.}}

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;" >Curtain Rises - The Journey Begins</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;" >Part 13</span>
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Let's see, my role is... Um...}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Not at this moment, but something that is in— Belongs in? Seen in...? The future...}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Feels like something that'd be nice to have...}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Not in a heavy way, but more like— Clink! A bright atmosphere?!}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|And also...like...someone that's full of "hope"!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Lalafin, stop right there!}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|What!?}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|You're explaining the role of "Hope", so you can't use the word 'hope', right?}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Ohh, that's right! Oops...}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Aw, this "Self Introduction Etude" is too difficult!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Heh, I guess so.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|By giving a self introduction, you'll be able to gain clarity for your role and come up with a better picture.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|I thought this practice method would be perfect for the tricky roles this time.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Right, Misora-chan?}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Yes! My family's theater troupe often does the same thing.}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|That said...you're right – it is a tricky role.}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|Lalafin's "Hope".}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|Misora's "Faith".}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|And my "Charity"...}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|We're playing three Major Arcana cards from the Visconti-Sforza tarot deck.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Yes, that's right! I didn't know about the Vi... Bi... Biscotti one!}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|It's Visconti-Sforza. I'm interested in fortune-telling, so I knew about it, but...}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|The most commonly used one that everyone knows is the Tarot of Marseilles with the 22 Major Arcana cards.}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Is it a really old tarot deck? That um... What was it again? Vi... Bi... Big Bang...?}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|Visconti-Sforza. And yes, it's the oldest one in the world.}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|Both the numbers and Arcana cards are different from the Marseille version. There's no information on the upright and reverse positions either.}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Ngh, there are too many unknown aspects.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|That's what makes it interesting! It's because it's unknown that we can create something new!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Creating a new future at the ends of the barren wilderness! That's definitely our stage!}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|A perfect casting for us from Frontier School of Arts!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|It'll be rewarding! Rewarding for sure!}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Aruru... Well, yeah, you might be right!}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|Amemiya-san from the script team said that to us, right?}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|How it's difficult, but is also exactly why she wants Frontier to make it into something new.}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Our Frontier Spirit is being tested!}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Whoa, this is a huge responsibility!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Heh heh... We can't lose either, Aruru-chan.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|My Arcana, "Judgement"...}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|My Arcana, "Moon"!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Both are used in numerous works.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|That's why we have to come up with a surprising portrayal to create a role that no one has ever seen before.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Of course! }}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Our "Wild Pirates" unity won't lose to anyone anywhere!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|We'll captivate the whole theater with a performance no one has ever seen before!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|The happiest stage we'll all create together! The lead roles in the "Performance Festival" will be us!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Aruru...}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin & Tsukasa & Shizuha|......}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Let's do our best at rehearsals from tomorrow!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Aruru|"Let's do our best at rehearsals from tomorrow!"}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|...Even after I said that—}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Why has no one come to rehearsals since then?!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|I've been all by myself ever since the first script reading was over!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Why? I don't get it! Is Tsukasa-chan going to all the sweets shops?}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Is Lalafin researching a new transformation pose?!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Is Shizuha-chan playing games overnight?}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Is Misora busy with her part-time job?!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Where is everyone?!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Now's not the time to be practicing by myself... I have to go find them!}}

{{CharTalk|Shizuha|"My... How arrogant..."}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|"One day, 'Judgement' will fall upon this foolish decision...!"}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|......}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|...This is no good.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|This kind of ordinary acting... "It's not good enough".}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|It needs to be more intense and persuasive, otherwise..."I can't win".}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|What should I do...?}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|...That's right.}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Aww... They're nowhere in the school... Where did everyone go...?}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Don't leave me all alone... Huh?}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Oh... That's Shizuha-chan!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Shizuha-chan, I found you!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Hey! Why haven't you been coming to rehearsals?!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|...Oh... Aruru...chan.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|No one's coming to rehearsals, you know?! Shizuha-chan, do you know anything—}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|...What are you doing?! Why are you pinching yourself?!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|My "Judgement"...still hasn't come to life.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|It's not good enough... My character isn't alive yet...}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|That's why I have to wake it up with extreme pain—}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|S-Stop, stop!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Aruru-chan, don't stop me!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|I need to feel strong pain to be able to play a role that casts 'judgement' on others!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|T-This is for understanding your role...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|This is wrong! Why do you have to push yourself to such lengths?!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Because "it's not good enough"... Because "I can't win"!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Shizuha-chan, you ARE good enough!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|You are you, so you just need to do your own acting! There's no need to beat anyone!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|To have to corner yourself like this for role preparations... It won't become a fun and happy stage at all!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Fun and...happy stage...}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Aruru-chan, do you really think that?}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Huh...?}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Do you really think...that the "Performance Festival" stage is a happy stage?}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|You didn't feel anything? After seeing everyone at the first script reading...}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|I-I did? Maya-chan's lightning and Akira-chan's thunder...!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Your gradual pace and Tamao-chan's brisk pace!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Then you should know...}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|The "Performance Festival"...is hell.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Huh...? Hell...?}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Even with the rough unfinished first draft of the script...everyone is competing fiercely to become the center of the play – the lead.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Become the center of the stage, release the best brilliance under the brightest spotlight, insist on being the lead—}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Sing, dance, and compete...}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|......!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|If you go on with these half-baked feelings...you'll just get killed by the stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Everyone knows this, so that's why we're all facing it by ourselves.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Tsukasa, Lalafin, and Misora-chan too. In order to self-reflect and become stronger.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Th-That's... That's not right.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Because we're friends... No, family! We're a family creating the same stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Why do you have to do it by yourself?! Let's move forward together! We can do a camp or have sleepovers!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|What's wrong with everyone?}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|What's the matter with all of you!?}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Aruru-chan...}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Aruru-chan, you're—}}

{{CharTalk|Elle|Revue...}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|A spellbinding performance conjured out of song and dance...}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Andrew|The one who shows the most brilliant Revue and lights the fire in the young girl's heart...}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|—Will be on the path to become the "Unknown Lead".}}
{{CharTalk|Elle & Andrew|Revue has begun.}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Heartbroken loneliness as I fall with broken feathers. The neon lights invite the stage of bonds.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|If "now" and "reality" are but a night's dream, I'll carve my flight onto the stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Stage Girl — Shizuha Kocho! I spread my wings, to Frontier!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Sparkling bullets, loaded onto wings and heading into the wilderness, looking for a free stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|The spotlight is a goldrush, and with both hands, grab onto that BIG DREAM!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Stage Girl — Aruru Otsuki! Against the wind, to Frontier!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Elle|"Timeless Play"...}}
{{CharTalk|Andrew|Struggling for the "Unknown Lead"—}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Sing.}}
{{CharTalk|Andrew|Dance.}}
{{CharTalk|Elle & Andrew|And compe—}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|No competing!}}
{{CharTalk|Elle & Andrew|Wha—?!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|I... No, we won't fight.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Elle, Andrew. I...will change the rules!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|We're a family! Five in one! We're a family creating the same stage!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|That's why there'll be no fighting between us. Never.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|If we have to fight... I'll fight in everyone's stead!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|I'll take everyone there! To the "Unknown Lead"—}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|I'll make everyone the "Unknown Lead"!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Aruru, why are you still saying such things?}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|"I'll make everyone the 'Unknown Lead'".}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|You think that would make us happy...?}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Huh...?!}}

{{CharTalk|Elle|Huh...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Andrew|W-Why are you guys here?!}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Audio, backdrop, and stage equipment help carry out Stage Girls' dreams... That's what a stage is, right?}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|I have to go. To that stage— Hup!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Aruru!}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Lalafin JUMP!}}
{{CharTalk|Andrew|A-All three of you—}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|They jumped onto the stage!?}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Everyone...!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Aruru...}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|You... "How long are you going to stay standing there for"?}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|As you are right now, you can't stand on the same stage as us.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Misora...?}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Be hungry, demand, compete... That is what Stage Girls are, no?}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Which is why...we can't stay as a close family forever.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Lalafin...!}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|No matter what stage, there's always only one lead. If someone is standing in the lead position...}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|You either get off the stage...or take over the lead. Those are the only two choices.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Tsukasa-chan, you too...!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Creating the happiest stage with everyone is nothing but an illusion... A faint and fleeting night's dream...}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|We are friends and rivals at the same time. We're rivals fighting to become the "Unknown Lead".}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Shizuha-chan, stop...!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|That's why...we're disbanding the "Wild Pirates".}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|...!!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|...No ...I don't want that...}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|No, I refuse! I refuse to do that!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|We finally became friends... We finally became family.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Yet why do we have to fight among ourselves as family members?}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|Aruru...}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|In which case... That's fine then.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|If I have to fight everyone for it... I don't want to become the "Unknown Lead"!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|......}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Why are you against it so much? What are you afraid of?}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|You, who lit up the path I needed to go down on with so much confidence—}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|You, who gave me the strength to declare what is important to me—}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|You, who taught me the importance of seeking the best and continuing to think—}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|You, who gave me the courage to not fear getting hurt— Why?}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Because it was all for everyone's sake! I could do my best because it was for everyone!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Because I...}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|...I have nothing when I'm by myself. Without everyone, without the stage... I have nothing.}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Aruru...}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Andrew... I want to ask you to change the Revue battle card.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Frontier's Revue...will be Aruru Otsuki against the four of us.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|......?!}}
{{CharTalk|Andrew|Y-You can't just decide that...}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|...I understand. We'll change it.}}
{{CharTalk|Andrew|E-Elle?!}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|Stand up, Aruru Otsuki.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|This is what you dug up within me. Passion and determination...}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|That's right... "Revue Frontier" is beginning.}}
{{CharTalk|Shizuha|I'll be the one to dig it up this time – your brilliance.}}
{{CharTalk|Tsukasa|If you don't have the strength to continue walking in the wilderness, take your fall here and put an end to it.}}
{{CharTalk|Lalafin|If you have the will to move forward in the wilderness...defeat us and move on!}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|Show us, Aruru Otsuki...}}
{{CharTalk|Misora|—Who are you?}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|......!}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|My name is Aruru Otsuki.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|I was raised surrounded by many people.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|I have my dear friends and respected seniors...and my important stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|I'm very happy.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|But... I know nothing about myself.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|About my parents or where I was born.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|When I was picked up, I had a piece of paper with "Aruru" written on it with me.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|I had nothing.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|But... That day when the "Sky Blue Theater Troupe" visited the orphanage—}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|That's when I met the stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|I was touched by Misora's acting and said I wanted to join the theater troupe...}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|The sister was really happy to see me show my own will for the first time and let me join the theater troupe.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|After that...Misora played the lead, Dorothy, in "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" and I stepped on my first stage as the dog, Toto.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|That day...I met the stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|But I... I know nothing about myself.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|And neither do I want to know.}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|Because I have the stage now. A stage I can stand on with everyone—}}
{{CharTalk|Aruru|—I have that. I do, I do have that.}}
