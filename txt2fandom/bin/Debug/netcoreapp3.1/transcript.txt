<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;" >Play Ball!</span>
{{CharTalk|Girl|Pssh, clink!}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|I saw this during my walk today. It looked so fun...}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|It's called "base ball"!}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|But when I said to everyone we should try, they said it's more fun to play at home...}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|But that's not true! It's not true... right?}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|"Base ball" is really fun, right!?}}
{{CharTalk|Girl|That's right, I'm sure the older girls would...}}
<hr>
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(The hot, melting sun beams down. Burning heat that makes it difficult to breathe.)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(Sweat drips down and gets sucked up by the field immediately...)}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Nice to meet you, I'm Karen Aijo! I've been the relief pitcher all through junior high!}}
{{CharTalk|Senpai|Then why don't you show us what you've got?}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|I can throw the ball!? Yay! All right, I'm ready...!}}
{{CharTalk||*swoosh*}}
{{CharTalk||*THWAP*}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(I still remember that moment. The day I set my goal in baseball.)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|("I want to stand on the same field as you"...)}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk||*flip*}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|(I ended up buying it anyways... The high school baseball magazine.)}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|(And of course my name isn't in it.)}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Junna-chan, found you♪}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Morning, Nana. And Hanayagi-san and Isurugi-san too.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|*yawn* Good morning...}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Hey, you're heading to practice, right? Let's go—... Ah!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|That's this month's baseball magazine!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Oh, there's an article on Seisho Sports Academy...}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Following the trend? You don't have to complain so–}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Hanayagi-san. You have 5 copies of the same magazine sticking out of your sports bag.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Huh!? T-That's not it! I was just going to hand this out to everyone...!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Ahem! Tendo-han, Clau-han, you should be saying good morning first. Where are your manners?}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Yes, ma'am. Bonjour.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|...So what's written in it? Can I see?}}
{{CharTalk||*flip*}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|"The new Seisho Sports Academy!! After Seisho regrettably missed their Koshien victory, how have they changed after the third years retired?"}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|"First, you have Maya Tendo and Claudine Saijo who garnered attention in the Junior League."}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|"Strong players who can hit and play defense. After these two who can be called the leaders of the new generation is..."}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|"The amazing fast runner Futaba Isurugi who wows everyone with her base-stealing skills. Kaoruko Hanayagi with her ironclad guard that doesn't allow the opponent to take the lead."}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|"And then Nana Daiba, the hard hitter with an unparalleled batting average."}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|"At a glance, it doesn't look like they have any glaring problems..."}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|"Their biggest hurdle may be whether or not they'll be able to unify their group of star players with strong, individual personalities."}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|"It puts the skills of the new captain Mahiru Tsuyuzaki to the test..."
Huh, the article is shorter than I thought.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Tell me about it. It doesn't even mention Hoshimi-han.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|...It's expected. I was a substitute last year.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|There's also one more person who wasn't written about–}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk||*THWAP*}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Nice throw, Karen-chan!! That was a good curve!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Really?!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Yeah, a sharp throw... I don't think there are any other high schoolers who can throw a curveball like that.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Heh heh, it's all thanks to you practicing with me all the time!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Not at all...}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|All I did was receive your pitches...}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|As expected of our secret weapon, Karen-chan♪}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Phew... What a monster pitch.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Yes. When she first joined, they were all crazy wild pitches...}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Ever since she learned to control them, they've transformed into powerful pitches.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|After honing the strength, you can definitely call her our unshakable ace now.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Oh! Our teamwork has also improved a lot too... The problem the article mentioned is no biggie!!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|That's true, but...}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Junna-chan?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Tsuyuzaki-san has been doing nothing but helping Karen and everyone else with their practices.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Will the captain... be able to play the way she would like to?}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Oh, everyone's here... Gather around!}}
{{CharTalk|All|Yes!!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|I've mentioned it before, but the first years are having their training camp now... So from today, practice will only be us second years.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Our goal is to get our hands on a ticket to Koshien.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|For that to happen, we need to be strong enough to win the spring tournament. So today, we'll be drilling the basics.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Heh heh, guess we can't lose to the first years... If we're too careless, we might end up getting dropped as regulars!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|About that... I have one more piece of news to share...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|What is it, Captain?!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|...The coach told me a new girl will be transferring into our team.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|And she wants her to be a regular...}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|What...!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|That's ridiculous!!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|We worked our butts off to become regulars! Karen and Junna have also been working like mad...!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|E-Everyone, calm down! It hasn't been decided yet–}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|...There's also a transfer rule when it comes to high school baseball.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Transfer rule?}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|When someone is transferred from a different school, they can't participate in official matches for one year.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Oh, what? The coach doesn't even know about that...?}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|I don't think she would've said that without thinking things through...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|You're right... But what I want to know is...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Are you fine with that, Captain?}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Huh?!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|I'm asking if you're fine with just giving a position to some transfer student.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Or are you trying to be okay with it... because you're the captain?}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|That's... well...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|...If you can't give me an answer, then fine. Let's start practice.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|I have no intention to just give up a regular position. I'm sure even the first years who aren't here...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|I just want to practice right now.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|......}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk||*CLINK*}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Nice one, Junna-chan!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Yes!!}}
{{CharTalk||*slide*}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Whoa...!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Hoshimi hitting such a low ball, it's as intense as a real match.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|That's probably how much the conversation from earlier provoked them.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|But everybody is heated up. And the next batter is...}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Vas-y! I'm up!!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|It's Clau-ko. How far is she going to send the ball flying— ... Huh?}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Who's that?}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Never seen her before... Why are they inside the fence?}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Captain, are you going to talk to them?}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|......}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Tsuyuzaki-san?}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Ah! Oh, I'm sorry... What is it?}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|There's someone not in the team over there—}}
{{CharTalk||*THWACK*}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Watch out! The ball—!!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|What is she doing?! Move out of the way!!}}
{{CharTalk||*thwop*}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|You're kidding...}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|She caught Clau-ko's ball with her bare hands...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Um, are you okay?! Are you hurt...?}}
{{CharTalk|????|......}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|H-Hikari-chan...?}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Huh... Karen-chan, is this your friend?}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...I finally found you.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Hikari-chan... You're really Hikari-chan!!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Heh heh... I'm back, Karen.}}

{{CharTalk|Hikari|(Tears drip down and get sucked up by the field immediately...)}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|*sniffle*... *sobs*}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|You're crying more than when you lose a match...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|It's because... we might never meet again...}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...Don't worry. I'll definitely come back.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|The field you stand on is my home to return to...}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Karen|Hikari-chan! You're really Hikari-chan?!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Yes, it's really me.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Oh my god!!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Sorry to interrupt you, but...}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Yes, can you please explain? You two are friends?}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Yes.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|What does that...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Haha! Hikari-chan, you're so cheer and contrite!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari & Mahiru|You mean, clear and concise... Oh.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari & Mahiru|......}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...I'm Hikari Kagura. I recently transferred to this school from England.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|You must be...}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|The rumored transfer student!!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Rumored...?}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|You must be the transfer student joining as a regular player the coach was talking about.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|I don't know. I only told the coach I wanted to join the baseball team.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|...How much experience have you had with baseball?}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|British national team – uniform number 2. I was the catcher.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|British national...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Number 2—? That means you're a regular!!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|C-Catcher...?}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Yeah! Hikari-chan is amazing!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|No matter what ball gets thrown her way, she will catch it and send it right back!!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|In Little League, we used to always be paired together as pitcher and catcher!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|B-But Karen-chan's catcher right now is me...}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Hm. If you know all of Karen's quirks, then you'd definitely be a great asset to have.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Wait a minute. What about that thing about the transfer rules for high school baseball?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|...It's fine.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Exchange students from abroad don't count. She can participate in matches.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|...A loophole, huh.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|*sigh* It's so obvious the school is willing to do whatever it takes to win...}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Well, I'm sure all of us would like to win...!}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|While I do have mixed feelings about all of this, first I'd like to see what her skills are.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|I agree. Then let's swap Kagura-san in for the practice—}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Wait!!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Huh...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|T-The catcher... That's the one position I'm not giving up!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|I'm the one who will receive Karen-chan's pitches!!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|M-Mahiru-chan...!?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Tsuyuzaki-san...}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...I also have no intention of giving it up. I'm the one who is suitable to receive Karen's pitches.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|That's some confidence right there...}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|You've got guts, I'll give you that... But to be honest, I don't approve.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|I don't like the idea of giving away a regular position to someone who just appears out of nowhere!!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|W-Wait, wait! Why is it turning out like this?!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Arguing and talking about approval... This isn't baseball!!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|But positions are things you have to fight for.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|That's true, but...!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Hey, I have an idea...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|How about a baseball match with everyone here?}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Baseball match...?}}

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;" >Wounded Friendship</span>
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Junna-chan, what is this baseball match...?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Baseball issues should be resolved on the field... We'll have a short match and decide on the victor.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|But there's no way we'd be able to have a proper game with these numbers.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Yes... So my suggestion is to split into teams of 4 and have a mini game.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|The catchers, Tsuyuzaki-san and Kagura-san, will be the team leaders. The remaining three will guard first, second, and third base.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Wait a minute... Are you saying we have to cover both infield and outfield with only three people? That's impossible...!}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Oh... With the bamboo bats we use for practice?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|That's right. The balls don't fly as far with those.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|In that case, we only need to cover the infield.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|...Hm? Wait a minute. Then the pitcher for this game...??}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Yes, Karen will be the only pitcher.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Only me...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|In this instance, Karen has nothing to do with which team wins or loses.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|She only needs to follow the catcher's lead and keep pitching.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Right, Karen-chan can throw most curve balls so...}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|The game will be highly dependent on the catcher's lead!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|That match would only work with a crazy pitcher like Karen-han who can throw any kind of ball...}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Then what about the number of innings? I'm sure pitching nine innings for both teams would be too much even for Karen...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|I can pitch that many balls?! Yay!!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|What if you hurt yourself... Even if you're fine with it, we can't allow that. How about we do 4 innings?}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|I can't believe she said "yay"... She's a monster...}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|But Hoshimi-san... Why are you suggesting this baseball match all of a sudden?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Because...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|I thought this would be the best way to settle it... That's all.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|If Tsuyuzaki-san's team wins, then the catcher will remain as Tsuyuzaki-san. If Kagura-san's team wins, then...}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Karen-chan's catcher will become Kagura-san...!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...Fine with me. Let's split the teams.}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk||*SLIDE*}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Nice, Hikari-chan!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Good job, Kagura!!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|......}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Phew, bases are loaded again... I didn't think it'd be this tough.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Huff, huff... They're in the lead by 4 points...!}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Hoshimi-san, stay focused! You'll get targeted again!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|I know...!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|The opponent keeps hitting towards Hoshimi-han who isn't good at defense... That's a dirty move.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Not at all. When you see a weakness, you strike... As long as this is a match, there's nothing we can say about it.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Even so, they're hitting way too many! When Kagura-han was the catcher, we barely got any hits...}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Without a doubt, that's...}}
{{CharTalk||*CLINK*}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|A hit, but that's a foul... A close one...}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|So I'm not just imagining it. Her pitching has become more flat.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Ugh! What are Karen-han and Mahiru-han doing?!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Huff, huff...}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(Karen-chan is getting tired... It must be tough to continuously pitch like this.)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(Okay, I'll signal her to throw an easy one...!)}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|(......!!)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(Huh, NO?! I-I see... I guess letting Karen-chan throw the way she wants is best.)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(Then the curve ball that Karen-chan wants...)}}
{{CharTalk||*CLINK*}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|S-She hit it?!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|It's going towards Hoshimi-han again!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Ngh...!}}
{{CharTalk||*slide*}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Ah, ugh...!!}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Junna-chan?!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|I'm fine... The ball I missed just hit my foot... Ngh!}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Junna-chan, we have to ice it...!}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|She's right. You shouldn't move around. It's unfortunate, but we should end the match here.}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Then it's Kagura-han's win for taking 4 points...?}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|...!!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|......}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...All right, we can have a rematch on another day when her injury has healed.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Huh...?!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Well, you're not satisfied with the result.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|There's no way you... can beat me how you are now.}}

{{CharTalk|Karen|Banana sure was angry! She said you refuse to stay still and rest!!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Nana is making such a big fuss... It's just a bruise. I'm fine already.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Is that so? Jun-Jun, you're always working too hard...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Don't push yourself so much. You're an important member of the team!!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Member of the team...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Jun-Jun?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|You're right... But it hasn't been decided if I'll be a regular or not yet.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Oh...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|I don't mean to blame you or anything.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|I just think... baseball is a cruel sport.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Um, what do you mean?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|...We have grueling practices day in and day out for the sake of winning that one championship.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Members who can't keep up with the rigorous training drop out one after another...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Do you think we'd be able to just enjoy playing baseball with the remaining members?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|You and I who used to be substitutes should be fully aware of this.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|...Yes.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|If we don't take the position away from our friends, we wouldn't even be able to join the match...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|......}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Hey, Karen... You said it before the baseball match we had the other day...}}

{{CharTalk|Karen|We compete and aim for the one victory... But that's not all there is to it.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|We pitch, we hit, we run. We show each other our everything.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|And when we gather everyone's feelings of not wanting to lose together, it becomes a winning brilliance!!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|That's why...!!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|...You really don't change.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Huh?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|What you told me on the bench at Koshien a year ago hasn't changed one bit.}}

{{CharTalk|Karen|Oh. Go Seisho!?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|That's the cheer.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Um... it's hot?}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|You did say that too. Didn't you drink like five bottles of water?}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|I didn't drink THAT much! Only four!!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|That's not much different.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|You looked at the mound and said you would definitely stand there one day.}}

{{CharTalk|Maya|Sure. The settings on the pitching machine are the same as usual.}}

{{CharTalk|Junna|Because that's how we've always grown stronger—!!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|......}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Huh... Hikari-chan?}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Why are you just standing here? Spying on the enemy?}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|I was just passing by. I'm leaving already.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Really, now. You looked quite interested.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|It's your imagination.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|I see... There's something I've been wondering about.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Why did you propose a rematch? It doesn't benefit you in any way.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|......}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|And then it hit me. Maybe you're testing us too...}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Whether this is the right place for you and Karen... Whether we can continue to win and stand on the field.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...Who knows?}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Oh... Wait, Hikari-chan!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|What is it?}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Do you want to practice together? We're a team, right?♪}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Not right now.}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Heh heh... Not now, huh.}}

{{CharTalk|Junna|...No matter how it turns out, this is it.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Oh, sorry...! Before we start the match, can I say something first?}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|What is it?}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Um, thank you for today!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|And... Sorry if I sound rude, but...}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|I won't give up! I'll show you the kind of baseball girl I am through this match!!}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|Hm... Sure. All right then...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Play ball!!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Hi-yah!}}
{{CharTalk||*CLINK*}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Over there, Hoshimi-san!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|What a shot! ...Oh no, she's not gonna make it!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Ngh!!}}
{{CharTalk||*slide*}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|No way, she caught it...!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Heh heh, it's hard to beat a person who never gives up...  A quote by Babe Ruth.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Argh... I thought it'd be a home run!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|No points since it was caught. Their movements have improved from last time.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Moreover, I can't read Karen's pitches! Is this...}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|The result of their special training?}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...That's not all there is to it.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|There's no holding back or hesitation in her lead. She can read what pitches everyone is bad at or excels at.}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Hmm. Meaning something has changed with her?}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|Looks like it. So this is what she meant...}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|This is Mahiru Tsuyuzaki's baseball girl!!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|All right, final inning and we're in the lead by 1 point...! Captain, Karen-han, we're counting on you. Don't let them hit it!}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Non! Not so fast. The bases are loaded.}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|The next batter up is...}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|......}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|Hikari-chan...!}}
{{CharTalk||*swish*}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...Come at me.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|HAAAH!}}
{{CharTalk||*CLINK*}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|She hit it?!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Wait, look at the ball!}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|Yes, it's a foul.}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|But look at how far it went. If she got the timing right, it might've been a long hit...!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|*huff* *huff*}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(Strike, strike, foul... Let's make the next pitch the last one, Karen-chan!)}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|(Okay... But based on the current flow, a straight pitch might let Hikari-chan hit!)}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|(So I should do a curve for the last one too...)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(You can't, Karen-chan! Kagura-san definitely knows how Karen-chan feels.)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(You mustn't throw a curve ball out of worry!)}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|(But...)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(Don't worry, I know you're an exceptional pitcher, that's why...)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(Let's win this together!!)}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|...!}}
{{CharTalk||*swish*}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|(She's winding up!!)}}
{{CharTalk|Maya|(That form... A straight pitch?!)}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|(Right in the center? Is she for real?!)}}
{{CharTalk||*THWAP*}}
{{CharTalk|Nana|S-Strike...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Batter out...!}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|It's over!!}}
{{CharTalk|All|Whoa...!!!}}
{{CharTalk|Futaba|You did it! Congrats!!}}
{{CharTalk|Kaoruko|Hey, we're your opponents. You shouldn't be congratulating us.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|Heh heh yeah, but...}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Yeah! That was so fun!!}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Thank you... It's all thanks to everyone...}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|You don't need to thank us.}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|We did it for ourselves... We showed brilliance for the team.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|...I'll accept the result of today's match, but I have no intention of losing.}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|I haven't given up on being the catcher... being Karen's catcher.}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Heh heh, bring it on!}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|Then are we good?}}
{{CharTalk|Claudine|I want to start practice already. Look out on the field... The first years are waiting.}}
{{CharTalk|Karen|Oh...!!}}
{{CharTalk|Junna|She's right... Captain?}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|Okay! Gather 'round...!!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Junna|(The hot, melting sun beams down.)}}
{{CharTalk|Hikari|(Burning heat that makes it difficult to breathe.)}}
{{CharTalk|Mahiru|(Our overflowing feelings are all sucked up by the field, becoming one...)}}
{{CharTalk|Junna & Mahiru & Hikari|(That's right. The field "you" stand on is where I belong...)}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Andrew|...Hm. This is such a hot and sweaty script!}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Andrew, here's a handkerchief for your tears.}}
{{CharTalk|Andrew|*sniff* Ahem... I could be the baseball mascot at the very least for the next professional baseball piece!}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Heh heh, a new story like that might exist somewhere.}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Stage girls who compete for one thing have become baseball girls who fight to become one...}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|With everything combined, this signals the end of this play.}}
{{CharTalk|Elle|Everyone, please be careful on your way back...}}
