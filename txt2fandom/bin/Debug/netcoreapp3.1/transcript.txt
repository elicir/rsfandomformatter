<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;" >Clothes Chosen by My Brother</span>
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Shiori, thanks for coming with me to buy undergarments.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|I also wanted to go shopping, so I was happy you invited me.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|But wouldn't it have been better for you to invite Yachiyo-senpai instead? I'm sure she'd love to help you pick out clothes.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|You know her well. And you're right, Yachiyo would be a huge help! She would definitely be able to find something that suits me.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|But in return, we'd end up spending a lot of time checking out all the shops.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Today, I just wanted to get it over with in the neighborhood. That's why I didn't invite her.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Yachiyo would probably be frustrated over not being able to check out different shops as well.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|You're probably right. I'll do my best to help you find what you need in Yachiyo-senpai's stead!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|No, don't worry about me. You should look for your own stuff and enjoy this shopping trip. Look, we're here!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Wow... There's so much cute stuff...! Oh, they even sell clothes...!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|When I found this shop, I knew I had to bring you here!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Haha, thanks. I had no idea they had such a shop here.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|It only opened recently. What were you planning to buy today?}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|I just want a new pen. Something that's easy to write with and looks cute...}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Okay! Then I'll pick one out for you!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Really?}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Leave it to me! Oh, but you're the one who'll be using it, so maybe you should pick one yourself.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|No, I want you to pick one out for me, please!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|If you say so! Let's head to the stationary section then!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|(Mei Fan-senpai ended up buying the pen for me... The chihuahua on the top looks like those capsule toys she likes to collect... So cute.)}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|(Once she's finished paying, I have to thank her properly.)}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Oh... This outfit is adorable... Oh, this too... It's lovely!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Thanks for waiting, Shiori... Huh?}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|This skirt is lovely too... Hm, it's so hard to choose.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|'''(Belle's Brother)'''<br>"Belle, all the clothes are begging to be chosen by you."}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Huh...!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|'''(Belle's Brother)'''<br>"Do you like this skirt? Here, let your brother have a look. Where's the mirror?"}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|'''(Belle)'''<br>"Oh yes, okay..."}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|'''(Belle's Brother)'''<br>"...It looks good on you. Let's pair it with this unicorn jacket. You like horses, don't you?"}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|'''(Belle)'''<br>"It looks lovely... But maybe it stands out too much."}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|'''(Belle's Brother)'''<br>"Not at all. It looks so good on you the passersby are stunned by your beauty."}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|'''(Belle's Brother)'''<br>"Lastly, put on this chili pepper pattern hat... What do you think? You are now the cutest baby sister in the world!"}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|'''(Belle)'''<br>"Oh, stop it. And I like horses, but not chili peppers. They're too spicy."}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|'''(Belle's Brother)'''<br>"Hahaha! You can take this chance to come to like them. The chili peppers are saying they like you, though."}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|'''(Belle)'''<br>"Stop joking around. If you're going to say that, then your dinner tonight will be a chili pepper full course meal."}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|'''(Belle's Brother)'''<br>"That would be terrible. But if you're the one making it, then I'm sure I'll enjoy every last bite!"}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|'''(Belle)'''<br>"What am I going to do with this big brother of mine..."}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Thank you for the pen, Mei Fan-senpai. I'll be sure to treasure it.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Just a token of my appreciation for you coming along with me on my shopping trip. It's nothing! I'm glad you like it.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|But are you sure you don't want that skirt from earlier? The unicorn jacket also looked really good on you. And of course the chili pepper hat too!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|They're lovely, but I think I'll sit on it a while longer...}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|I like how you always think things through carefully before making a decision. If you're going to get the chili pepper hat though, let's get matching ones!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Sure! You surprised me earlier with the sudden etude. And as Belle's brother too.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|There's actually another reason why I invited you. I've been re-reading past scripts in preparation for my "Performance Festival" interview...}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|I read the "Beauty & the Beast" script last night and was reminded of when we acted as siblings.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|So when I saw you picking out clothes, it rekindled the same feelings I had when I was playing your brother. And before I knew it, I started an etude!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|That certainly brings back memories. Your highlight scene was the fight with the Beast, but I loved the scene where you played with animals the most.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Both scenes show his love for his sister. When he confronts the Beast who he thinks had fooled Belle, he has this fierce expression.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|But when he's playing with the animals with Belle, he has this doting smile.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Speaking of animals, when the rehearsals for "Beauty & the Beast" first started, we met this chihuahua called "Belle", didn't we? Oh, but its real name was "Shiro"...}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Belle...! I mean, Shiro...! *sniffle* No, I decided I wouldn't cry anymore...! But Shiro! *sniff* Shiroooo...!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|I'm sorry, Mei Fan-senpai. Here, take my handkerchief.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Thank you... Shiro... I'm so glad... she got reunited with her owner... Thank goodness. But I'll never be able to forget... that forlorn bark of hers...}}
{{CharTalk||Arf! Arf arf!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Yes, that's how Shiro would bark...}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Mei Fan-senpai! It's actually Belle... I mean, it's Shiro-chan!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro|Arf arf!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Wait... Whaaat?!}}

Chapter 2=
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;" >Shiro Is Lost Again</span>
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Belle...! I mean, Shiro! It's Shiro!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro|Arf arf!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Ouch... You still like climbing on my shoulders! You're so adorable...!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Um, Mei Fan-senpai. Where's Shiro-chan's owner...?}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|What? You got lost again, I see. You're really just as naughty as Belle in the "Beauty & the Beast".}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|I'm sure they're worried sick. Let's go find her owner.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Okay! But where should we even start?}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|There's a park nearby. Let's start there!}}
<hr>
{{CharTalk|Meifan|I thought this would be the place if she had escaped during their walk... But I don't see them.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro|Arf!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Shiro, are you worried? It's okay, we'll definitely find your owner for you!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro|Arf!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Heh heh, good girl.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|She must feel calm because you're holding her.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Really? You think so? All right, let's split up and search the park!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Yes!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Shiori! Any luck?}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Huff... Huff... No, I didn't see them anywhere.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|I see... Shiro, just hang tight a little while longer.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro|Arf!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|...! Mei Fan-senpai, there's a tag on Shiro-chan's collar... Maybe their contact info is on it.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Oh! Smart! Let's have a look here...}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Thank goodness the owner's contact info is on there.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Thanks to you for noticing! Shiro, your owner will be here soon!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro|Arf! Arf!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Heh heh... Who would've thought we'd end up looking for her owner again.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Yes, it's just like that time when we were doing "Beauty & the Beast".}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|This reunion feels like fate. I might talk about Shiro and what happened today at the "Performance Festival" interview!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro|Arf!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Looks like Shiro-chan agrees. But... do you think Yukishiro-senpai would be okay with that?}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|As an "Edel" and a chosen stage girl, there are concerns over talking about something that isn't directly related to the stage, but don't worry.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|For this interview, they want to hear about any rehearsal period stories that influenced or made us feel closer to the stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Which means our seniors are aware of it.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Yes. To the outside, Siegfeld's first impression is always our strictness.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Unique stages created through strict discipline. It's our school's strength and also our pride. But I want to tell people we're a school that combines discipline with benevolence.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Should I also bring up that kind of story in my interview?}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|If you want to. I also plan on talking about Siegfeld General Hospital.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro|Arf arf!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Heh heh, you sure are energetic, Shiro. I don't think you need to go to the hospital.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Siegfeld General Hospital... You mean that psychodrama? The one that turned my nightmare into a good dream...}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Oh, I'm sorry. Is it something you don't want talked about?}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Oh, no...! That's not it. It's also a good memory for me.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Then that's fine... Oh, in that case, once I've organized my talking points, would you like to go over the content with me?}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|I want you to look at what I want to say about the General Hospital and decide if there's anything you'd like left out!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|That's very kind of you. But I'll leave the decision up to you. If Yukishiro-senpai and Michiru-senpai are fine with it, then I'm fine with it too.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Thank you! If I can talk about the General Hospital, I think it will add value to the story about the exchange program with Seisho, "Holmes Vs. Lupin"!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Add value?}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Yes, in "Beauty & the Beast" you fight with Shiro for you name, and in the General Hospital, Akira-san encourages you and you put on a performance that rivals the upperclassmen from other schools.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|I can't talk about the current "Frau Jade" without explaining your growth! }}
{{CharTalk|Shiro|Ark! *whimper*}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Shiro feels the same! Hehehe.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro's Owner|Oh, Shiro... There you are!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro|Arf arf!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Oh, hello! It's nice to see you again!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Long time no see! Shiro's been waiting for you!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro's Owner|Oh my, thank you for looking after her... I'm sorry for causing you trouble again.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Not at all. Shiro-chan was such a good girl.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro's Owner|Thank you very much... That reminds me. Thanks to your encounter with Shiro last time, I went and watched your "Beauty & the Beast". It was marvelous. After that, it got me interested in theater.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Oh, really? I didn't know!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro's Owner|You're Belle and the older brother, right? I remember you two well. You were just like real siblings... Heh heh, brings back memories.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|I'm so happy to hear you still remember!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro's Owner|Of course. I will never forget that "Beauty & the Beast". Thanks to you, my life has become a lot more fun.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Your life...!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro's Owner|Since then, I've become your fan. I look forward to seeing more of your performances.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro|Arf arf!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro's Owner|Yes, I know you're hungry. Let's go home.}}
{{CharTalk|Shiro's Owner|Please keep on doing your best. And thank you again for looking after Shiro.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Oh, it's nothing. Please be careful on your way back!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Thank you! Goodbye!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|......}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|To have someone from the audience... tell us directly that our performance has made their life more enjoyable. That's so touching to hear!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Yes, I'm also really moved! It made me so happy to hear that!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|It's amazing that we can make such a positive influence to someone's life through our stage.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|It really is! I want to continue to deliver that kind of stage... No, WE will continue to!}}
{{CharTalk|Shiori|Yes!}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Let's hurry back and organize what to say for the interview! I'm raring to go!}}

Bond Level 15 Talk=
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Shiori seriously looks good in anything. When I complimented her, she got all embarrassed and was adorable. I can't help but see her as my little sister.}}

Bond Level 30 Talk=
{{CharTalk|Meifan|After reuniting with Belle—No, Shiro, it reminded me of when we performed "Beauty & the Beast".}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|Meeting Shiro brought the Edels together. Shiori was able to focus on Belle and Akira-san was able to capture the Beast's kindness.}}
{{CharTalk|Meifan|I can't wait to talk about this at my interview! I'll be able to show a different side of the "Edels"!}}
